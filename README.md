# Qubership Integration Platform — Engine

Engine service is a part of Qubership Integration Platform.

This service:

- Creates context for integration flows (so-called integration chains) using configuration provided by [Design-Time Catalog](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-integration-designtime-catalog), [Runtime Catalog](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-integration-runtime-catalog), and [Variables Management](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-integration-variables-management) services.
- Manages registration of integration chains' endpoints on control plane.
- Runs integration chains.
- Records sessions of integration chains' execution. These records can be later accessed via [Sessions Management](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-integration-sessions-management) service.
- Collects various metrics of integration chains execution.

Engine service uses [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) for defining and execution of integration logic.

Engine service publishes integration chains' deployment state to Consul.

To store recorded sessions of integrated chains' execution, the service uses OpenSearch.
It creates if not exists index in OpenSearch and sets up index rotation policy via [ISM](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/im-plugin/ism/index/).

## Installation

Variables Management Service is a Spring Boot Application and requires Java 21 and Maven to build.
[Dockerfile](Dockerfile) is provided to build a containerized application.
It can be run locally using a [docker compose configuration](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-integration-platform).

## Configuration

Application parameters can be set by environment variables.

Configuration can be overridden with values stored in Consul.
The `config/${NAMESPACE}` prefix is used.

Application has 'development' Spring profile to run service locally with minimum dependencies.

## Dependencies

This service relies on [Design-Time Catalog](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-integration-designtime-catalog), [Runtime Catalog](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-integration-runtime-catalog), and [Variables Management](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-integration-variables-management) services.
It also requires:

- Consul
- OpenSearch
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (if idempotency support enabled).
